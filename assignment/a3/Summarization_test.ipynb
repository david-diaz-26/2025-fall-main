        "Pegasus is an encoder decoder architecture that has been explicitly pre-trained as an abstractive summarizer.  You can read more about it [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/pegasus) and [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.08777.pdf).\n",
        "\n",
        "We'll first use the `google/pegasus-xsum` checkpoint.  It is trained on a [summarization task](https://aclanthology.org/D18-1206.pdf) that reads a news article and then [emits a one line summary](https://huggingface.co/datasets/xsum).  This doesn't mean that it is limited in its output length.  It does mean that it works well with news article type inputs and tends toward shorter outputs."
